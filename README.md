#Python Trading Bot - Strategy Development
Currently this dev environment connects to the Binance exchange for the data used to build and backtest strategies. You should install jupyter notebook and work with an .ipynb file as itâ€™s easier to create code cells for each strategy and view plots in the workspace.

##Get started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the *trader/* directory.
3. Run `./launch_book.sh` and have at it.
